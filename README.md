The Millennium Development Goals were a set of 8 goals for 2015 that were defined by the United Nations to help improve living conditions and the conditions of our planet. Key indicators were defined for each of these goals, to see whether they were being met. We will have a look at some of the key indicators from Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability, namely carbon dioxide emissions, protected land and sea areas, and forests.
